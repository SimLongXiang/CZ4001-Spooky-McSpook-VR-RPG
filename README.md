*You find yourself in a forest, all alone in the middle of the night. Will you survive the night?*


# INTRODUCTION
Situational awareness skills can make a difference in everyday life, whether in work or just going about our days. Our project helps users improve these skills with an immersive, stimulating VR RPG game experience.Socio-economic forces are increasingly pushing us towards optimizing the relationship between effort and resulting value. In general, the global industry is shifting more from physical to mental work. We also see that as our society becomes safer, develops more technology, and relies more on mental work, we lose our physical awareness. Often we find ourselves walking and waiting with eyes glued to our smartphones. Even at the gym, we tune into our music and tune out of the world around us. These raised a few issues:

•	An increased amount of accidents where pedestrians walk into traffic without looking
	
•	Sober persons driving as poorly as if they were intoxicated because of texting while driving
	
•	People in need of assistance going unnoticed because no one is paying attention


# Objective
•	To create an open world explorable in Virtual Reality
	
•	Make interesting enemies to create unique and challenging gameplay

•	Make gameplay and combat mechanics highly immersive for the player

•	Promote situational awareness by punishing the player for not paying attention
